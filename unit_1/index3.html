		<h3>Our Story</h3>
		<hr>
		<h4>How it all began</h4>
		<p>A short while back, Matt and Ryan went to a benefit that Magic Johnson was hosting for the Boys & Girls Club of America.These guys are really big Magic fans. And when we say really big, we mean Matt cried so hard after they lost game 1 of the 1988 NBA Finals, his parents let him stay home from school the next day. He was 12.So you could imagine how pumped they were for the chance to join their childhood hero courtside at a Laker game and then get dinner after. They thought about how amazing it would be to win, to hang out with the man they idolized, to ask him everything about everything...And then the auction got started. As broke college students, Matt and Ryan could do nothing but watch helplessly as the bidding reached $15,000.

		On the drive home, they couldn't stop talking about it. Why should life's most amazing experiences only go to the rich? How could the most awesome prize in the history of mankind (they'r'e really big Magic fans) only raise $15,000 for such a great cause? That's when it hit them. What if they made these same types of opportunities available online, and for a mere $10 donation anyone could have a chance at winning? More people would get involved, plus you would raise a lot more money for these amazing causes.</p>
